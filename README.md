# Problems
## I had a lot of problems setting cookies. I am not sure I even understand how they work and would love to go over this assignment. The notes use a number and the kilgore notes include a function. I am just really confused. 
## I did not understand that the cookies were being stored so I did not understand why I had so many. I also dont understand how to store name a cookie. I also could not figure how out how to have the original text stay there before the name is entered. Like I said...very confused.
